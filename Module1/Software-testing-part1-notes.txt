Module # 1 - Part # 1
What is Testing?
======================
It's a pre-defined process to validate the requirements of the product or service to ensure it meets quality.

What is Software?
=======================
It's a set of instructions or programs that tell the computer what to do.

Types of Software
=======================
System Softwares 
Application Softwares 


System Softwares
-----------------
It's a middle layer between user and computer hardware. It manage computer hardware behavior and provide basic functionalities to users 
   Ex: Operating System (Windows, MacOs, Linux, Android) 

Appication Sotwares
-------------------
They are user programs that help them in  completing their tasks.
Example: Calculator app, Alarm Clock app & Notes taking app


Differences between System Softwares & Application Softwares
============================================================
System softwares					Application Software
-------------------					----------------------
All other softwares work well		Developed for a specific task
and maintain system resoures					

Uses low-level programming for      Uses high-level progamming
development							langauges 
Ex: assembly & machine langugages	Ex: Python, Java, C++ etc

The system cannot run without it.   System can run without it
Starts running when system starts	It runs based on user need
and stops when the system stops

Runs independently					Requires system software to run



What is Software Testing?
=============================
It's an activity to find issues / defects in the software.

Before releasing our software or application to the customers, we need to make sure that all the functionalities of the software are working as expected.

Software Testing can be divided into 2 steps

Verification - Ensures  that the software implements the functionality correctly

Validation - Ensure that software meets the customer requirements.


Why do we need to do Testing
=============================
Testing is important because software issue could be expensive or even dangerous. It can potentially cause monetary and human loss.

- Apr 26, 1994, Major Airlines Flight 140 crashed into the ground killing 264 of the 271 people due to software issue
 

- Software bugs caused the bank accounts of 823 customers of a major U.S. bank to be credited with $924 millions each in May of 1996

- In November of 1997 the stock of a major health industry company dropped 60% due to reports of failures in computer billing systems, problems with a large database conversion, and inadequate software testing


Why the Software has issues?
============================
- Miscommunication between teams
- Software Complexity
- Programming Erros
- Frequent requirement changes


Benefits of Software Testing
===========================
- Best quality product in the market
- Focus on actual business instead of fixing the issues
- Save lots of time and resources
- Improve customer satisfaction and trust
- More profit to the company

Module # 1 - Part # 2

Types of Software Testing
======================
Functional Testing
Non-Functional Testing

Functional Testing Types
----------------------
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- System Testing
- Acceptance Testing

Non-Fucntional Testing Types
-----------------------
- Performance Testing
- Security Testing
- Compatibility Testing
- Usability Testing

Functional Testing
------------------
Verfiying the functionalites of a product / system
Ensures system works as per the functional requirements
It specifies which functionalites need to be tested

Unit Testing
-------------
Individual component or units  will be tested
Mostly performed by developer
Usually White box methodology will be carried out
Identify bugs early in development process

Integration Testing
-------------------
Two or more modules of an application are logically grouped together and tested
To identify the issues between Integrated systems
Perofrmed by tester
Ensures that different Integrated sytems work together

System Testing
--------------
Complete system will be tested
Sanity, Smoke, End-to-End  tests will be performed
Perofrmed by tester
Ensures the whole system is working as per the requirements.

Acceptance testing
-----------------
Test the application / software with real-time scenarios
It is also called as UAT (User Acceptance Testing)
Perofrmed by clients / business users / customers
Last phase of testing before software goes live

Non-Functional Testing
---------------------
Verifies Non-functional aspects of the system / software
Ensures system meets all non-fucntional requierments
It specifies how well system should respond
It will reveal the pain points & confusion areas of the software
It helps to improve the user experience
It helps you to gather real feedback about the software


Performance Testing
-----------------
Assessing system performance in terms of  Speed, Stability & Scalability
Mostly performed by Performance Testers
It will be tested by applying load onto the system
Identify performance bottlenecks in the system.

Security Teting
---------------
Ensure that the system meets relevant security standards and regulations
It ensures only authorized or authenticated users allowed to access the system.
Evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to withstand an attack
Identify the potential flaws and weakness in the software sytem

Compatibility Testing
---------------------
Validates software behavior on different platforms, different configurations, different browsers
Ensures software works across all platforms correctly
Ensures consistent experience and performance of software all platforms.
To do this test software should be stable enough

Usability Testing
----------------
Software will be evaulated by real users  / customers
It will reveal the pain points & confusion areas of the software
It helps to improve the user experience
It helps you to gather real feedback about the software

Functional vs Non-Functional
============================

Functional                            

Validates functional aspects of the software
Based on customer requirements
Validates the code is doing right thing
Performs before Non-functionality testing

Non-Functional
Validate non-functional aspects such as reliability, performance 
etc
Based on customer expectations
Validates the code is doing it right way
Performs after functionality testing
Functional Testing
Non-Functional Testing

How testing will be conducted
===============================

Functional Testing
 - Manual
 - Automation

Non-Functional Testing
 - Except usability testing, rest of the testings will be conducted using tools.

 Testing Phases
 =============
 - Requirements Gathering
 - Test Planning
 - Test Case / script development
 - Enviornment setup
 - Test Execution
 - Test Closure

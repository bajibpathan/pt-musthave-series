Module # 2 

What is SDLC?
================

Software Development Life Cycle
Process that produces high-quality software
Ensures well-tested and ready for production usage

SDLC Benefits
===============

Reduced development and  production costs
Reduced software development risks
Increased Software quality
Improved customer satisfaction

SDLC Phases
==============

1) Planning
2) Requirement Analysis
3) Design
4) Implementation
5) Testing
6) Deploy
7) Maintenance

SDLC Models
============
1) Waterfall Model
- Traditional model, also called as Linear model
- Each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase
Advantages
----------
Clearly defined phases and goals
Requirements will be frozen, and hence less issues
Suitable for small software development projects
Disadvantages
---------------
Little or no room for change
Longer delivery time.
No feedback path until the end of the project

2) Spiral Model
Combines the iterative model's small repeated cycles with the waterfall model approach
Product released after completion of each cycle and used as a base for the next cycle
Advantages
-----------
Fast development
Flexibility in requirements
suitable for large and complex projects that require frequent changes

Disadvantages
--------------
Difficulty in time management
Expensive for smaller projects with a limited scope
End date of the project unknown in the early stages

3) V Model
An extension of Waterfall model where the model execution process flows in a "V-shape"
Each phase of the development has its corresponding testing phase
Advantages
----------
Best suitable for small projects
Simple, easy to understand and use
More disciplined model , Phases completed one at a time.
Disadvantages
-------------
Not suitable for large projects
Working software is produced late in the life cycle
Does not support iteration of phases

4) Agile model
Agile -"The ability to move quickly and easily"
Software develops in incremental, rapid cycles
Work is done in regularly iterated cycles, known as sprints
End of the sprint, working product will be displayed to customer for feedback

Advantages
----------
Realistic approach to software development.
Promotes teamwork and cross training
Regular updates, higher client satisfaction

Disadvantages
-------------
Less Documentation
Difficult to estimate overall project effort at the begining

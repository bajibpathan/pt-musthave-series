How to Record Script in JMeter?
===============================

What is a Script?
-----------------
A script is like a set of instructions or a code that pretends to be users doing some actions in an application or software system.

What is Script Recording?
-------------------------
Script recording is a technique used in performance testing to create test scripts by capturing and translating the interactions of a user with a web application.

Why Recording is required?
--------------------------
 - Efficiency & Time Saving
 - Complexity Handling

 How Recording Works?
 ---------------------

 When we perform the expected user action manually all the requests sent from the configured browser go via the proxy server and that's the local machine. 
As the JMeter sets to listen at the same port it can have a log of all the requests sent via a browser.

How to Record Script?
-------------------
We can record the JMeter script in 3 different ways

- Using HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder (Default JMeter utility)
- Badboy Software (Deprecated)
- Blazemeter Chrome Extension


HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder
----------------------------

- Add Thread Group and add Recording controller / Transaction Controllers
- Add Non-Test Element i.e. HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder

- Generate the JMeter Root Certificate and Import to Browswer
- Update the proxy server and make sure the port is same as in JMeter (Default 8888)
- Open the browser
- Start the recording
- Navigate the applicaiton transactions. If you have separate transaction controllers defined then select them as Target Controller before performing the step in the application.
- Validate the traffic during the recording.
- Stop the recording


Badboy Software (Deprecated)
----------------------------
- Download the software
- Install the software
- Make sure ther recording is ON.
- Type the URL address in the address bar
- Navigate the transactions and observe the traffic in the Tree pane.
- Export the user traffic to JMX from File menu.

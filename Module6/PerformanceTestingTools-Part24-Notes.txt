Types of Thread Groups
======================
A group of virtual threads or users is represented by a Thread Group.

Types
------
Thread Group (Default)
Arrival Thread Group
Free Form Arrival Thread Group
Concurrency Thread Group
Stepping Thread Group
Ultimate Thread Group
Open Model Thread Group (latest)

Some of the thread groups are available by default for someone we need to install "Custom Thread Group" plugin.


Thread Group (Default)
---------------------
- Default and standard thread group elements
- Many load testing scenarios can be desinged using this element.
- It is based on concurrency and there won't any options to gradually ramp down the users.
- JMeter will stop all the user simulanteously once the test ends.

Arrival Thread Group
--------------------
- This thread group will be available using custom thread group plugin.
- It is used for Thorughput based scenarios.
- Based on the arrivals/sec, JMeter will create the required threads.
- No gurantee for the concurrency.


Free Form Arrival Thread Group
------------------------------
- This thread group will be available using custom thread group plugin.
- This element also works exactly same like Arrival Thread Group
- It excludes the Arrival thread configurations such as ramp-up time and ramp-up steps count.
- It will help us to create a flexible schedule

Concurrency Thread Group
-------------------------
- This thread group will be available using custom thread group plugin.
- It is mainly focused on the concurrency.
- Concurrency Thread Group doesnâ€™t create all threads upfront, thus saving on memory.

Stepping Thread Group
----------------------
- This thread group will be available using custom thread group plugin.
- It is the old version of Concurrency thread group
- It also primiarly focus on Concurrency.
- In this element, the ramp-up and ramp-down configurations are done differently in comparison with the Concurrency Thread Group.

Ultimate Thread Group
---------------------
- This thread group will be available using custom thread group plugin.
- Highly customizable thread group
- Many performance testers will use to create their load testing scenarios.

Open Model Thread Group (latest)
--------------------------------
- This is recently released with JMeter 5.5 version
- This work similar to Arrival thread group. However, we can create customize scheudles
- We can also JMeter functions to define the rate and ramdom_arrivals


Based on the given requirement, we may need to choose the most suitable type of thread group.

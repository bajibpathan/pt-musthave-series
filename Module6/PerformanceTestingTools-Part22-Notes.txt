JMeter + Jenkins Integration
============================

Jenkins is an Automation platform to automate all sorts of tasks related to building,testing and delivering or deploying the software.

Two Important terms:
-------------------
Job -> A description of work
Build -> Result of a single execution of a Job


Build Types:
------------
FreeStyle Project
 - Simplest way to creat the build by specifiying list of commandsto acheive a task
Pipeline
 - Grouping different tasks and divide them into stages


CI / CD 
-------
CI -> Continuous Integration
CD -> Continuous Delivery / Deployment

Organizations will follow the CI/CD practices to implement DevOps culutre to deploy quality and realiable product.

CI stages
---------
-> Build
-> Test
-> Scan
-> Upload

Once the CI stages are completed then the build will deployed in QA, Staging and Production environments

The difference between Continuous delivery and Deployment
- In Continuous delivery, the build will be deployed in Production with manual approvals
- In Continous deployment, the build will automaitcally deployed in Production along with other environments like QA, Staging etc


Commands used in FreeStyle Project:

set message="Hello World"
echo %message%
dir
echo "Sample file" > sample_file.txt
dir

pipeline script with Jmeter script
-----------------------------------

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone') {
            steps {
                echo 'Clonig the repo from GitHub'
            }
        }
        stage('Execute') {
            steps {
                echo 'Execute Jmeter Script'
                bat """
                <jmeter.bat complete path> -n -t <script location> -l <results location>
                """
            }
        }
        stage('Publish Report'){
            steps {
                echo 'Publishing Report'
                perfReport sourceDataFiles: '<results location>'
            }
        }
    }

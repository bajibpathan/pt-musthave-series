JMeter Architecture Elements
============================

Test plan
Threads (Users)
Sampler
Config Element
Timer
Logic Controller
Pre Processors
Post Processors
Assertions
Listener
Test Fragment
Non-Test Elements


Test plan
---------
Root or top-level element under which all other elements will be configured.
Serves as the backbone of the performance test 

Threads (Users)
---------------
Provides a set of instructions used for simulating the virtual user load. 
Commonly used element in this type is Thread Group.
Defines number of threads (virtual users), ramp-up duration and number of iterations.

Sampler
-------
Send specific types of requests to the server. For example, HTTP Request for Web request
In other tools, they call it as "Protocol".
Can be added as a child element to Thread Group element.
Can't be added as a child to Test Plan element.

Config Element
--------------
Closely work with Sampler element.
It helps in configuring and customizing different other elements.
Ex: CSV Data Set config can be configured to store the test data

Timer
-----
It helps to define wait time or dealy between sampler requests.
Control number of requests to the server

Logic Controller
----------------
Manages the flow of the requests sent to the server.
Control the order or repetition of the requests.

Pre Processors
-----------------------
Executs some action before a sample request made.
Allows to modify or manipulates the samplers requests


Post Processors
-----------------------
Executes some action after a sample request made.
Allows to extract the data from responses.

Assertions
----------
Validation checks to verify if the server response meets the criteria.
Acts as a quality checkpoint, verify various aspects such as repsone data, timing and duration.

Listener
--------
It helps to display the results
Present the data in various formats like Graphs, tables etc 


Test Fragment
-------------
Added to minimize the script size
Purely for code re-use
It main consitency,reducing the redundancy

Non-Test Elements
-----------------
Not directly involved in test execution.
However, play an important role.

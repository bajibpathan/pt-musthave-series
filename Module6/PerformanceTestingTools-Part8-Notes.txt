JMeter Architectuere Elements - Part 1
======================================

- Test Plan
- Thread Group
- Sampler (HTTP Request)
- Listeners
  - View Results Tree
  - View Results in Table
  - Aggreggrate Report


Test Plan
---------
- Default parent element created by JMeter
- All other child elements like Thread Groups, Samplers etc will added to this element.
- It is not possible to remove
- User defined Variables section can be used to define some common variables that can be used in all samplers.
- Run Thread Groups consecutively - To run thread groups sequentially
- We can add additional jar dependencies to test the application in the test plan element.


Thread Group
------------
- Most commonly used Threads element.
- This is the first element that needs to be added in the scripting.
- Thread Groups are used to create threads. Here Threads are nothing but Virtual users.
- Action to be taken after a Sample error section can be used to control the script execution in case of any Sampler error.
- In Thread Properties section, we configure number of Threads / users, ramp-up duration and number of iterations.
- We can also execute the test by defining the test duration by selecting the Specify Thread Life time.

Sampler
-------
- These elements are used to send the user requests to the server using the respective protocol.
- There are many elements available like HTTP Request, FTP Request, JDBC Request etc
- For testing web applications or APIs, we generally use HTTP Request sampler.
- We have configuration options available in 2 tabs (Basic & Advanced)
- Basic configuration tab will be used to configure basic options like protocol, server name, port, method and additional parameters of the request.
- Advanced configuration tab will be used to configure advanced options like Client implementation, Timeouts, Proxy server etc

Listeners
---------
- Listeners display the test results.
- We have so many listeners available and "View Results Tree" is commonly used one during the scirpt devleopment process.
- View Results in Table can be used to view the results in the tabular format.
- Aggreggrate report will be used to view the agreggrated results.
- By default, the agreggrated report will show 90th, 95th and 99th Percentile.
- You can modify this by updating aggregate_rpt_pct1 in jmeter.properties file.

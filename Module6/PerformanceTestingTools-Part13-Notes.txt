Parameterization
================

During the script recording, we might be giving lot of input values and JMeter will record all the actual values.

Executing the test with the same values with mutliple users is not realistic scenario. 

So, the process of replacing the actual input values with variables / parameters is called Parameterization.

Vairable name synatx:

${variableName}

ex:
${userName}

We can handle the parameterization using the elements like

- User Defined Variables
- User Parameters 
- CSV Data Set Config 


User Defined Variables
----------------------
- It is a config element and suitable to parameterization static variables like protocol, servername etc
- We can only assign only one value in the variable


User Parameters
---------------
- It is a Preprocessor element and it is used to define user specific values to individual threads.
- We can assign multiple values to each variable.


CSV Data Set Config
-------------------
- It is a Config Element and it allows you to read data from a CSV file and use it in the script.
- It is more suitable when the values in the script chagned every iteration.
- We can also assign mulitple values in each variable.

Important Configuration of CSV Data Set Config is "Sharing Mode"

Sharing Mode Options
--------------------    
- All threads - CSV file will be shared with all threads and every thread will read one line sequentially.
- Current thread Group - CSV file will be shared each thread group and they will open it separetly. Inside the thread group, all therads will follow the all thread methods to read the data.
- Current thread - CSV fill will be shared to each thread and they will read the data from the begining independently without affecting each other.
- Edit - Sharing mode will be turned into an input field and we can specify the thread group that we would like to share the CSV file.


Functions used in the script:
Thread # ${__threadNum} : Iteration # ${__intSum(1,${__jm__Thread Group__idx})}

To add Dummy Sampler, go to Options -> Plugin Manager and look for Dummy in the available plugins and then install the Plugin.

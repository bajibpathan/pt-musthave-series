Modularization
==============

Modularization means breaking down a large and complex piece into smaller, self-contained parts. 

Copying the repetative steps in all the scripts is not correct approach. If any changes to the repetative steps, then we may need to do it in all the scripts.

To address this kind of challenge, we need to follow the Modularization process.

In JMeter, Modularization can be achieved using the Test Fragment & Module controller or Test Fragment & Include controller combination.

Module controller & Include controller can be added to Thread Groups

Thread Group
|---Logic controller
     |----Module Controller or Include Controller

Using Module Controller, Test Fragment should be available inside the same test plan.
Using Input Controller, we can save the Test Fragments as a separate jmx file.

Config Elements
===============
Config elements are used to setup default values and variables to be used by samplers.


HTTP Request Defaults
---------------------
The main purpose of the HTTP Reqeust defaults is to avoid data duplications and make it test plan more maintainable.

HTTP Header Manager
-------------------
HTTP Header Manager element lets you add or override the HTTP request headers.
Ex: 
Accept-Language:en-US
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br

HTTP Cookie Manager
-------------------
We can handle cookies using HTTP Cookie Manager element.
It helps to simulate the real web browser behavior. 

HTTP Cache Manager
------------------
We can use HTTP Cache Manager for addig caching functionality to HTTP requests to simulate browser cache feature.
Every resource downloaded from the server has Last-Modified value in the header which incidates the last-modified time of the resource and Etag which is an identifier of the specific version of the resource.
If HTTP Cache Manager is used then for every new sampler if verifies the available cache entries using these headers before making request to the web server.

User Defined Variables
---------------------
User Defined Variables are used to define the variables that are used throughout the test plan.

Controllers
===========
Logic Controllers determine the order in which Samplers are processed.


Simple Controller
-----------------
It serves as a logical container to group together various samplers, controllers, and listeners. 

Loop Controller
----------------
It allows you to repeatedly execute its children a certain number of times.

Only Once Controller
--------------------
It Process the elements inside it only once per thread.

Runtime Controller
------------------
It allows you to control the duration for which its child elements like samplers etc. should run. 

Random Controller
-----------------
It allows you to execute its child elements (samplers, controllers, etc.) in a random order.

Interleave Controller
---------------------
It is used to alternate among the samplers or child controllers placed inside it.

Transaction Controller
---------------------
It groups a set of elements (samplers, controllers, etc.) together to represent a transaction. 


If Controller
-------------
It allows you to control the execution of its child elements (samplers, controllers, etc.) based on a condition. 


Timers
======

Timer elements aer used to pause the JMeter threads for certain amount of time. 

Constant Timer
--------------
It can be used to pause each thread the same amount of time between the requests.

Uniform Random Timer
--------------------
This element can pause each thread request for a random amount of time. 

Constant Throughput Timer
-----------------------
It is used to delay the threads to meet the throughput goals.


Assertions
==========
To validate the server response on the basis of some pre-defined conditions.


Response Assertion
------------------
Checks whether the server's response contains specific text, patterns, or expressions.

Duration Assertion
------------------
Verifies whether the server's response time falls within a given amount of time.

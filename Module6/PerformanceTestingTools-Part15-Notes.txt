These arguments will vary from function to function. Some functions may take arguments and some not.

Function Groups:
Information: To retrieve or display the information.

We also have "Function Helper Dialog" which will provides assistance and information about the various available functions.

Counter: ${__counter(TRUE,counter_var)}
dateTiemConvert: ${__dateTimeConvert(01262024,MMddyyyy,dd/MM/yyyy,)}
random Number: ${__Random(10,100,random_Num)}
random String: ${__RandomString(15,ABCD$@#3435,random_String)}
UUID: ${__UUID}
JavaScript Random Number: ${__javaScript(Math.floor(Math.random()* 10),javascript_rand)}
Change Case: ${__changeCase(jmeter is fun to learn,CAPITALIZE,case_var)}
Encode: ${__urlencode(https://jmeter.apache.org?test)}
Decode: ${__urldecode(https%3A%2F%2Fjmeter.apache.org%3Ftest)}

We also have a Custom JMeter Functions which will provide additional functions.

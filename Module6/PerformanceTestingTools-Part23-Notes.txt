Throughput Controlling Elements
============================

What is a Throughput?
It is the amount of data successfully processed within a specific timeframe. 

Formula:
--------
Throughput = number of requests / total time 

What will happen if we donâ€™t control Throughput?

If we don't control the throughput then we may see the below in the test
- Unrealistic Simulation
- Inaccurate Performance Metrics
- Failure to Identify Bottlenecks

JMeter Elements
---------------
Throughput Controller
Weighted Switch Controller
Constant Throughput Timer
Throughput Shaping Timer

Weighted Switch Controller & Throughput Shapring Timers are plugins and we need to install them using plugin manager before using the elements.

Sample Throughput requriements:

Functionalities
===============
 -> Login           : 150 TPS   -> 50% -> (150 / 300) * 100
 -> Account Summary : 90 TPS    -> 30% -> (90 / 300) * 100  
 -> Transfer        : 60 TPS    -> 20%-> (60 / 300) * 100
                    ===========    
Target Throughput   : 300 TPS  -> 100%

# Performance Testing - Must Have Skills - Series

This repo is for aspiring performance testers who would like to learn the essential performance testing skills. This series has been divided into 8 modules. In each module, we will foucs on the core concept of the module with real-time examples. The concepts that we are going to dive deep into in each module has been listed in the [course-index](https://github.com/bajibpathan/pt-musthave-series/blob/main/course-index.md) page. Please note that, this index page will be regularly updated to keep the series up-to-date.

For each module, I'll create a folder in this repo with that module number and update all the references and the important concepts for a quick overview.

## Module 2: SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) Concepts

You'll explore about the SDLC and its objective and difference phases. You'll also learn the different SDLC methodologies.

<br>

## Module 3: Server Architecture Basics

For any technology, it is important to understand the server basics first before diving deep into that technology. You'll understand the concept of server and different types of servers. You'll also learn different types of architectures. You'll also learn the fundamental concept of Protocol.

## Module 4: Peformance Testing Core Concepts

This is one of the important modules in this series. Here, you'll explore the core concepts of performance testing. You'll dive into the purpose of performance testing and different types of performance tests that performance testing teams will conduct. This module also helps you understand the Performance Testing Life Cycle (PTLC) and its different phases. You'll understand the different methodologies that performance testers will follow during workload modeling. You'll also gain the understanding of the different terminologies.

## Module 5: Programming Language Concepts

In this module, you'll be introduced basic core programming concentps with Apache Groovy. You'll explore the important concepts such as Variables, Data Types, Conditional Statements, Loops and many more. The reason for chosing Groovy is that it will be used in Apache Jmeter performance testing tool which will introduced with Module 6. Understanding the core concepts of Apache Groovy will definitely help you to master the performance testing tool.

## Module 6: Performane Testing Tools

Apache Jmeter is an open source tool being used many organizations these days. In this module, you'll understand the process of installing the tool and how to use this tool in both GUI mode and also Non-GUI mode. You'll explore the different elements of JMeter and its built in functions. You'll also gain the knowledge of scripting enhancement concepts i.e., Coorelation and Parameterization. You'll also learn the way test exectuions will be done using this tool. Tips & Tricks and will also be shared to master this tool.

## Module 7: Monitoring Tools

This module focuses on performance monitoring concepts. You'll learn the monitoring implementation areas. You'll be introduced to some native monitoring tools and also the Application Performance Monitoirng tools.

<br>

## Module 8: Documentation tools

Finally, you'll be introduced to the Microsoft components such as Word and Excel. These components will be extensively used for documetations. You'll also be introduced to Confluence.

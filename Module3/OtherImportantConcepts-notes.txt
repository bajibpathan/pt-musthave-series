Know Your Servers
=================
In performance testing, both software and hardware configurations are essential factors.

Hardware
--------
CPU
 - Architecture
 - Number of cores
 - Clock speed etc

 	HDD(Hard Disk Drive)
 	RAID (Redudant Array of Independent Disks)
 	  RAID 0
 	  RAID 1
 	  RAID 5
 	  RAID 10
Networking
 - Bandwidth
 - Latency
 - Throughput

Environments
============

A collection of hardware and software tools that team will  use to build software systems

Development Environment
Testing Environment
	- SIT Environment
	- UAT Environment
	- Performance Testing Environment
PreProd / Staging Environment
Production Environment

What is a Protocol?
====================
A set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices across a network to exchange information easily and safely.
Communication Protocols
 Determines formats and rules for data transfer
	- HTTP
	- TCP
	- UDP
	- IRC
	- FTP
	- SMTP
Management Protocols
 Used to troubleshoot the connectivity problems
	- SNMP
	- ICMP
Security Protocols
 Uses encryption in order to keep the data secure
 	- HTTPS
 	- SFTP
 	- SSL

Other Architecture Components
=============================
CDN (Content Delivery Network)
	 A CDN is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users
	 Akamai, Amazon CDN, Azure CDN, CloudFare 
Proxy
	A proxy is an intermediate server that acts as a gateway between the client and the server.
	Reverse Proxy, Forward Proxy
Firewall
	A firewall is a network security device or software application that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet.
Load Balancer
	A load balancer acts as the “traffic police” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests


URL and it's components
========================
URL - Uniform Resource Locator
http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html

http -> Scheme
www.example.com -> Domain Name
80 -> Port
/path/to/ -> Path to file
myfile.html -> Resource

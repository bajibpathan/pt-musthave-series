 - Expensive, hard to manage

Virtual Machines:

It is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system. It is also called as VM.

Benefits
 - Cheaper to run
 - Higher resource utilization

Drawbacks
 - Vulnerable to the noisy neighbour problem
 - Vulenerable to the security attacks

Container:
A container is a lightweight and standalone package of an application with all its dependencies like libraries, framework and it's run-time.

Benefits
 - Required less hardware resource to run
 - Easy to deploy and maintain

Drawbacks

SLA Purposes
------------
Customer Expectations
Accountability
Monitoring
Dispute Resolution

What is a Requirement?
======================

It  is a documented statement that describes a specific feature, or characteristic that a software system must have to meet the needs of its clients.

Functional Requirements (FRs) - What should the system do?
Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) - How well should the system do it?

Functional Requirements (FRs) examples:
---------------------------------------
The system shall allow users to log in using a username and password.
Users should be able to add items to their shopping cart.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) examples:
---------------------------------------------
The system must have a response time of less than 2 seconds for 95% of user requests.
The system should be available 99.9% of the time


Performance Testing NFRs
========================
 - Avoid “Abstract / high-level“ requirements
 - Always gather “Quantitative“ requirements

Frequently gathered different types of Performance NFRs:

- Response Time
- Throughput
- Concurrency
- Scalability
- Resource Utilization
- Geographic Considerations



What requirements should we gather?
===================================

- Response Time
- Throughput
- Concurrency
- Scalability
- Resource Utilization
- Geographic Considerations
- Buisness flows / use cases
- Environment information (Produciton & Testing)
- External Dependencies  / 3rd Party Integrations

Service virtualization tools:
- CA Lisa
- MountBank
- Hoverfly Cloud

Requirements gathering challenges
==================================
- Incomplete / Conceptual Requirements
- Missing Stakeholder Involvement
- Changing Expecations
- Lack of Baselines
- Lack of Performance Testing Expertise
- Inadequate Data
- Incomplete System Knowledge

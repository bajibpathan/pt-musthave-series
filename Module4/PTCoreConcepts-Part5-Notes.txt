Performance Testing Types
=========================
In any performance testing type, the main two factors that will differentiate each test type is  "Number of virtual users and the test duration."

Ramp-up
--------
It is the gradual increase in the number of virtual users over a specified period.

Steady State
------------
It is the phase in a performance test where the system operates under a constant and consistent load.

Ramp-down
---------
It is the gradual decrease in the number of virtual users over a specified period, following the steady state phase.


Sanity / Dry run
----------------
Objective: Determines the test scripts, data, environment readiness.
Foucs: Idenitfying the issues related to scripts, data and environment configurations.

Load: 10% of peak load
Duration: 15~30 minutes (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Load test
---------
Objective: Determines the system's behavior under a specific expected load.
Foucs: Assessing response times, throughput rates, and resource utilization under anticipated user load levels.

Load: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% of peak load
Duration: 1 ~ 2 hours (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Endurance / Soak test
---------------------
Objective: Determines system performance over an extended period.
Foucs: Detecting memory leaks and gradual performance degradation over time.

Load: 70% of peak load or application average load
Duration: 8 ~ 12 hours (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Stress test
------------
Objective: Evaluates the system's performance by pushing it beyond its normal operational capacity.
Foucs: Identifying breaking points, understanding how the system fails, and observing recovery procedures.

Load: Beyond 100% peak load
Duration: more than 2 hours(Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Spike test
----------
Objective: Assesses the system's ability to handle sudden, rapid increases in load.
Foucs: Observing how the system copes with abrupt spikes in user activity.

Load: 100% of peak load with spikes
Duration: 1 ~ 2 hours (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Scalability test
----------------
Objective: Measures the system's ability to scale up or down in terms of user load or other factors.
Foucs: Assessing performance as additional resources (such as CPU, memory, or network) are added or removed.

Load: 10~20% of additional peak load
Duration: 1 ~ 2 hours (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Volume test
-----------
Objective: Evaluates the system's performance under a large volume of data.
Foucs: Checking database handling capabilities, response times, and resource usage as the dataset grows.

Load: 100% of peak load
Duration: 1 ~ 2 hours (Steady State) + Ramp-up and Ramp-down duration


Benchmark vs Baseline
======================

Benchmark: Industry standards or competitors applications performance
Baseline: Providing a standard for future comparisons within the same system

When will we conduct Baseline?

 - When there are no clear SLAs
 - During System version upgrades

Note: Typically Conducted under standard operating conditions, representing a typical user load and behavior.


How to choose right type of test?
==================================
- Not mandatory to conduct all the testing types
- Should be decided based on the Performance  goals and objectives

Note: Types of tests executed should be frozen in as part of performance test plan

Execution Order:
-----------------
Sanity / Dry run  (Mandatory)
Load test (Mandatory)
Endurance / Soak test (Mandatory)
Stress test (Optional)
Spike test (Optional)
Scalability test (Optional)
Volume test (Optional)

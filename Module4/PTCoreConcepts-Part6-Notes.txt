Types of Performance Metrics
=============================

A metric is a quantitative measure used to assess various aspects of an application's performance. 


Application Health Metrics
--------------------------
- Response Time
- Throughput
- Error rate

 These metrics reported by performance testing tools like LoadRunner, JMeter etc


Server Health Metrics
----------------------
- CPU / Memory / Disk utilizations

We have separate monitoring tools to gather server health metrics.


Perfomance Testing vs Performance Engineering
=============================================

Performance Testing - Identifying the issues
Performance Engineering - Identifying & eliminating the issues


Little Law
=========

Little’s Law states that the average number of items within a system equals the average arrival rate of items into and out of the system multiplied by the average amount of time an item spends in the system. 

L = λ * W
L = Average number of customers in a system
λ = Average items arrival rate
W = Average time a customer spends in the system


Benefits
---------
Improved efficiency 
Better customer service 
Improved resource utilization


In Performance Testing

N = X * Z

N = Average number of users in a system
X = Throughput (TPS)
Z = Execution Time (Response Time + Think Time + Pacing)

Little's Law purposes in Performance testing
Performance test results validation
Workload Modeling

Common Terminologies
=====================
- Virtual Users
  They are created by load testing tools like LoadRunner JMeter to simulate the real user behavior
- Simultaneous Users
  Simultaneous users will execute the same activity at the same time.
- Concurrent Users
  Concurrent users are active in the system. However, they will not test the same activity at the same time.
- Think Time
  A time gap between two transactions.
- Iteration
  Iteration in performance testing refers to a single execution of different transactions in the business use case from beginning to end.
- Pacing
  A time gap between two iterations.
- Response Time
  Response time is the entire duration from when a request leaves the user's computer, travels to the server, undergoes processing, and returns with the response to the client.
- Hits 
  The number of requests or transactions made to the server within a specified period.
- Throughput
  The rate at which a system can process a specific number of requests or transactions within a given time frame. 
- Bottleneck 
  A bottleneck refers to a point in the system where its performance is significantly degraded.
  Types:
  Software Bottlenecks and Hardware Bottlenecks

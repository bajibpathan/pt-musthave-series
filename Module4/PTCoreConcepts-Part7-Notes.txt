==========================
Question 2: Tell me your roles & responsibilities
            Explain PTLC & its phases
            Explain Performance testing process in your previous organization

Key Points:
Remember the PTLC phases and explain the different activities carried out in each phase.
To simply, you can divide PTLC into 4 phases (Planning, Preparation, Execution & Analysis)
Try to follow the same order of PTLC Phase
Refer EP 9

Sample Answer:
Planning
--------
Requirements gathering
  - understanding application changes
  - understanding application architecture
  - Understanding critical business use cases
  - Understanding workload characteristics
  - Understanding test data requirements
Estimating the effort required for Performance testing
Test plan preparation
Review Test plan with client stakeholders
Obtain sign-off

Preparation
-----------
Developing the scripts
Test data creation
Test scenarios creations
Validating the application and infrastructure monitoring
Performing Sanity test

Execution
----------
Executing the planned tests
 - Peak load
 - Endurance / Soak
 - Scalability tests
Gathering application health and Infrastructure health metrics
Preparing Interim test results

Analysis
---------
Comparison of the test results
Following up with support teams for tuning activities
Test report preparation with observations and recommendations

Try to explain each activity in 1 or 2 sentences. Don’t jump between phases. Share it a like a story.
==========================
Question 3: How to gather NFRs in performance testing

Key Points:
Remember these points and try to explain 1 or 2 sentences
Scheduling meetings with business teams
Review Technical documentation & NFRs
Historical data analysis
Review previous test results/baseline results 

Try to provide high-level explanation for each point
Refer EP 10

Sample Anwer:
First, we will schedule meetings with business stakeholders to understand their expectations. 
We will gather all the technical documents including Non-functional requirement documents to understand the application and its non-functional requirements. 
If the application is already in Production, we will gather the production metrics to understand existing workload usage. 
We will review the previous baseline or release test results to understand if there are any deviations from the production metrics.
Once the requirements have been gathered, we will set up a meeting with the business team to ensure that there are no discrepancies.
==========================
Question 4: If the client doesn't know anything about PT, what is the approach to gather requirements

Key Points:
Educate the Client
Ask Open-Ended Questions and provide examples

Try to provide high-level explanation for each point

Sample Answer:
We will try to educate the client by explaining the importance of performance testing and its impact on the success of the application. 
We will ask open-ended questions to encourage the client to express their concerns or expectations. For example, we will ask about their anticipated user load, response time expectation, and critical functionalities of the application.
We will provide some examples of performance metrics like response time, throughput, and error rates.
After all the discussions, we will document and review with the client.
==========================
Question 5: What are the challenges that you have faced while gathering NFR? 

Key Points:
This can be different from company to company or project to project
Lack of Clarity
Unrealistic Expectations
Incomplete Information
Try to provide high-level explanation for each point
Refer EP 10

Sample Anwer:
Most of the times, our clients lack a clear understanding of what metrics are relevant to their application. So, we have educated them and explained the importance of performance testing.
Sometimes, they come up with some unrealistic expectations about the application's performance like overestimating or underestimating. In such situations, we gathered the production metrics and re-evaluated their expectations with the metrics.
Sometimes, they don't document their Non-functional requirements about the usage patterns, anticipated user loads, and response time expectations. So, we have scheduled several meetings and gathered all performance-related requirements.
==========================
Question 6: How do you identify business use cases for any application?

Key Points:
Pareto’s Principle (80 / 20)
frequently used
highly critical
high resource intensive
Refer Episode 11 for more

Smaple Answer:
If it is an existing application, we always use Pareto's principle to identify business use cases. According to this principle, 20% of the frequently used business use cases cover 80% of the coverage. So, we will gather the use cases from production along with their usage and filter out the 20% use cases.

To filter those 20% use cases, we will follow certain guidelines like
The use cases should be frequently used
The use cases that are business critical.
The use cases that are highly resource-intensive

If it is a brand new application, we will discuss it with the business team and understand the frequently used scenarios, critical business uses cases and high-resource intensive use cases.
===========================
Question 7: Explain Test Plan / Strategy document sections
            Have you developed the test plan/strategy document?

Key Points:
Remember the different sections of the test plan and explain 1 or 2 points for each section

Test Plan Sections:
Test Objective
In scope & out of scope
Performance NFRs
Workload used for testing (number of users / TPS etc)
Performance Testing Process
Type of tests 
Entry and exit criteria
Project milestones/deliverables
Assumptions
Risk / Mitigations
Dependencies
Environment details
Monitoring Stratgey
Defect tracking process
Roles & responsibilities
===========================
Question 8: Deliverables of different phases
            Entry & Exit Criteria of different phases

Key Notes:
Sometimes they may ask you for any specific phase, 
what are the entry &  exit criteria for the execution phase?
What are the planning deliverables
To answer this type of question, you can refer to EP 9 Performance testing core concepts.

Sample Answer:
Before starting the execution phase, we need to ensure that test scripts, data, and environment are ready.
To exit from this phase we need to ensure that test results and infrastructure monitoring reports are available.
===========================
Question 9: Performance Testing Types & Objectives

Key Notes:
They may also ask you to talk about different performance testing types and their objectives
Refer Episode 12

Sample Answer:
We have different test types available. Based on the requirements, we will recommend and schedule the specific type of test.
For example, an Endurance / Soak test will be scheduled to identify any stability issues in the application. It also helps us to understand if we have any memory-related problems like memory leaks in the application.
===========================
Question 10: Common terminologies related questions

Key Points:
They may also ask you to explain the difference between think time and pacing ?
Refer Episode 13

Sample Answer:
Think time is a time gap between two transactions where as pacing is time gap between two iterations
===========================

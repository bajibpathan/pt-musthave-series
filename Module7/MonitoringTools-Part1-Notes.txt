Introduction to Performance Monitoring
======================================
What is Monitoring?
The act of observing and collecting the data over time

Why do we monitor?
To track and make adjustments for improvement

Where do we monitor?
In a general terms, mointoring will be done in every where. Some common example areas areas
Health Care, Finance, IT Systems, Security, Environment and many more

What is Performance Monitroing?
Monitoring the performance of an application or system(s)

How do we monitoring?
There are different tools available to monitor different aspects of the application or systems performance.
- Applicaiton performance monitoring will be done using performance testing tools like LoadRunner, JMeter etc
- System resource monitoirng will be done using native(in-built) tools. For exmaple, PerfMon for Windows OS and Unix based sytems, we will use top, iostat, vmstat, sar etc
- We can use Application performance monitoring or APM tools like Dynatrace, AppDynamics, NewRelic to monitor the application and system resources health.

Basically, all these tools will monitor the application/system and collect and report the different metrics for analysis purposes.

What is a metric?
A metric is a unit of measurement used to quantify or evaluate a specific aspect or characteristic of something.

Monitoring areas
- Application
- Server

Application:
It deals with over all application health.
Reported by performance testing tools
Example metrics:
- Response Time (Average & Percentile)
- User Concurrency
- Server Throughput (TPS)
- Server Hits
- HTTP Errors and many kore

Server:
It deals with over all server resource health
Reported by native tools / apm tools
Example metrics:
- CPU Utilization
- Memory Utilization
- Disk Utilization
- Network Utilization and many more

Along with the server resource utilization metrics, we also monitor server configuration metrics using APM tools.

Client Side Vs Server Side
---------------------------

Client Side:

Measures the performance at the client side (Browser)
Example Metrcis:
- Page loading time
- Number of page components (Image, CSS, JS)
- Number of HTTP Calls
- Number of Exceptions and many more

Client side monitoring will done using
- APM Tools, Fiddler, Browser Dev Tools, Google light house etc

Server Side:
Measures the performance of the server side processing
Example metrics:
- Transaction Response Time
- Server Throughput
- Server Errors / Exceptions
- Server Resource Utilization and many more

Server side monitoring will done using
- APM tools, PT Tools

What is KPI?
KPI Stands for Key Performance Indicator
KPIs are high-level indicators that reflect organization's strategic goals and objectives

For example,
- Revenue growth
- Customer satisfaction index etc

KPIs and metrics are often interrelated. But they are not the same thing.

### APM vs Observability

APM primarily concentrates on monitoring and managing the performance of applications. 

On the other hand, Observability takes a wider view, aiming to understand complex systems and solve issues effectively.

In essence, APM is a subset of observability, focusing on one section (application performance), while observability focuses on overall system behavior.

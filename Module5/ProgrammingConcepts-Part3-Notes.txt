First Program - Welcome to Groovy
=================================
//Java Program
 public class HelloGroovy {
      public static void main(String[] args){
         System.out.println("Welcome to Groovy);
     }
 }


 In Java, every application begins with a class definition and must contain the main method
The Java compiler starts executing the code from the main method.It's mandatory in a Java program.


//Groovy Prgram
println "Welcome to Groovy"

To execute Groovy script, the following command can be used

groovy filename
Example: groovy groovy-part3.groovy.

In Groovy it is not necessary to have a class or the main method.We can print a line without using round brackets. It is not necessary to put a semicolon at the end of the statement like in java.


Comments
========
A note that give explanation about the code (method, class or any logic etc).

Single-line comment
-------------------

// a standalone single line comment
println "Welcome to Groovy" // a comment till the end of the 


 Multiline comment
 -----------------
/* a standalone multiline comment
   spanning two lines */


 Groovydoc comment
 -----------------
/**
 * A Class description
 */


 Shebang line
 -------------
#!/usr/bin/env groovy


Keywords
========
Keywords are reserved words and we can't use them for defining variable names, method names etc

Reference: https://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_keywords


Variables
=========

Variables are storage locations with the assigned names. They hold data that you can change or use later.

It's always important to name them something meaningful.



Data Types
==========

Numbers
-------
They can be whole numbers (Integers) or decimals (floating values).

byte
short
int
long
float
double

byte b = 2
short s = 3
int i = 10
long l = 454544
float f = 15.35
double d = 6.78880

Strings
------

char
String

char c = 'a'
String str = "This is a String"

String interpolation
---------------------

int age = 28
println "Your age is ${age}"
println "The sum of 10 and 5 is ${10+5}"

String Concatenation
---------------------
println "Your age is " + age


Boolean
-------
true or false
boolean t = true
boolean f = false


In Groovy variables are case-senstive.

Dynamic Typing declaation
=-------------------------
Groovy is Dynamic typing. So, we don't define the data type during declaration.

def x = 10
dex str = "This is String"

println x.getClass()
println str.getClass()
